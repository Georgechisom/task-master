# TaskMaster: Task Manager App

# Project Title & Description

TaskMaster is a web-based task management application designed to help individuals (students, freelancers, professionals) and small teams (businesses, project groups) organize, track, and complete tasks efficiently. By offering an intuitive interface for task creation, categorization, prioritization, and collaboration, TaskMaster aims to boost productivity and reduce the chaos of managing multiple tasks, providing a seamless experience across devices with real-time sync and notifications.

Who It’s For: Individuals seeking a simple, reliable way to manage personal tasks, and small teams needing lightweight collaboration tools without the complexity of enterprise solutions like Asana.

Why It Matters: In a fast paced world, staying organized is critical. TaskMaster combines a minimalist design with powerful features like real time updates, reminders, and team task sharing, making task management accessible and efficient for diverse users.

# Tech Stack

# Frontend:

React.js: For building a dynamic, responsive user interface.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid, customizable styling.

React Router: For client-side routing (e.g., task list, calendar, profile).

Axios: For making API requests to the backend.

# Backend:

Supabase: Open-source Firebase alternative for:

Authentication: Email/password and OAuth login.

Database: PostgreSQL for storing tasks, users, and categories.

Real time: WebSocket-based subscriptions for live task updates.

Edge Functions: Serverless functions for notifications and custom logic.

# Database:

PostgreSQL (via Supabase): Relational database for structured data (users, tasks, categories).

# Additional Tools:

Vercel: For hosting the frontend.

Figma: For UI/UX design and prototyping.

GitHub: For version control and CI/CD via GitHub Actions.

Sentry: For error monitoring.

Jest: For unit and integration testing.

ESLint/Prettier: For code linting and formatting.

# AI Integration Strategy

AI tools, specifically Trae, will be leveraged throughout development to accelerate coding, ensure quality, and maintain clear documentation. Below is the strategy for integrating AI across key development phases:

# Code Generation

Approach: Use Trae to scaffold features and generate boilerplate code for React components, Supabase API integrations, and database schemas.

# Workflow:

Feed Trae prompts with specific requirements (e.g., "Generate a React component for a task creation form with title, description, due date, and priority fields").

Provide context like Supabase API specs (e.g., REST endpoints for tasks) or file structure (e.g., src/components/TaskForm.js) to ensure generated code aligns with the project.

Use Trae to create reusable utility functions (e.g., date formatting, task filtering) by specifying inputs/outputs.

Example Prompt: "Generate a Supabase query in JavaScript to fetch tasks for a user, filtered by status and sorted by due date, with error handling."

Outcome: Rapid prototyping of frontend components, API calls, and database interactions, reducing manual coding time by ~30%.

# Testing

Approach: Leverage Trae to write unit and integration tests for critical features (e.g., task CRUD, authentication).

# Tools:

Jest: For unit tests (e.g., testing task creation logic).

React Testing Library: For component testing.

Supabase Test Suite: For backend API tests.

# Workflow:

Prompt Trae with test scenarios (e.g., "Write Jest tests for a task creation API that checks for successful creation, validation errors, and unauthorized access").

Feed code snippets or file diffs to ensure tests cover specific functions or components.

Use Trae to generate mock data (e.g., fake tasks/users) for testing.

Example Prompt: "Create Jest tests for a React TaskList component that renders tasks from a Supabase query, handling loading and error states."

Outcome: Comprehensive test coverage with minimal manual effort, ensuring robust functionality.

# Documentation

Approach: Use Trae to craft and maintain docstrings, inline comments, and this README.

Workflow:

Generate docstrings for functions and components (e.g., "Add JSDoc for a function that updates task status in Supabase").

Use Trae to update README sections based on project milestones or feature additions, ensuring clarity for contributors.

Provide context like project scope or recent code changes to refine documentation (e.g., "Update README with new collaboration feature details").

Example Prompt: "Write a README section explaining the task collaboration feature, including how users share tasks via Supabase RLS."

Outcome: Clear, up-to-date documentation that reduces onboarding time for new developers or users.

Context-Aware Techniques

# Context Feeding:

Share Supabase API specs (e.g., REST endpoints, RLS policies) with Trae to generate accurate backend queries or security rules.

Provide project file trees (e.g., src/, components/, api/) to ensure generated code fits the structure.

Use git diffs to refine existing code (e.g., "Optimize this Supabase query based on the latest schema changes").

# Workflow Integration:

Integrate Trae in the IDE (e.g., VS Code with xAI plugins) for real-time code suggestions.

Use CLI commands to generate bulk code (e.g., "Scaffold a full task CRUD feature with React and Supabase").

Feed error logs from Sentry to Trae for debugging suggestions.

Outcome: Context-aware AI assistance that aligns with the project’s architecture, reducing errors and rework.
